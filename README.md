# Programs made for CS450 Data Networks
Six assignments I worked on for class. Directory and filenames are written as required by my professor. Weeks 5 and 8 use provided code from class textbook (Kurose & Ross, 2017) with the sections that I modified clearly labelled. The other weeks are entirely my own work.

* **Week1_Program_Code_Suggitt**  
C++ program that mimics a common analogy for network transmission and propagation delay.

* **Week3_Program_Code_Suggitt**  
Java program that simulates a finite state machine of a server sending data over a network and employs TCP style network congestion control.

* **Week5_Program_Code_Suggitt**  
Python ICMP client program that will send an ICMP ping request to a provided address and watches for a reply. My added code simply works the command line interface.

* **Week6_Program_Code_Suggitt**  
Python program that creates a CRC32 checksum of a given input file or string and appends it to the hex version of the input. This was my attempt at creating my own implementation of known published C versions (examples can be found in the comments).

* **Week7_Program_Code_Suggitt**  
Python implementation of MD5 algorithm (RFC 1321).

* **Week8_Program_Code_Suggitt**  
Simple video player made in python. My own modifications are found in files Client.py and RtpPacket.py with specifics labelled in comments. I fixed some imports, added some RTSP functionality, and added some RTP functionality.
